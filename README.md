# game-VBScript
it's a script in VBScript with the possibility to play chifoumi or make a quiz but as I'm french everything is written in french

# new
I have created an administration system
I also added a chifoumis as a game
And also a random password generator

# to launch the script
it's the "game.vbs" file

# important 
removed the contents of the files "users.txt" and "results.txt and "ban.txt"
to connect for the first time in admin use the account "admin" and as password "admin|admins" also when you will put user admin their password will finish by "|admins" because otherwise it will mark invalid password
for the chat system for the admins what is after the # is their id so it is what allows to delete the message

# installs
to get started make

	windows + r
  
in what has just opened wrote 

	cmd

then wrote


	cd Desktop

and finally wrote


	git clone https://github.com/Matteooettam10/game-VBScript.git
